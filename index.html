### CPSC 120

*Lab 1
Lab 1 was and always hold a special place in my heart becasue it was 
the first interaction and introduction into computer science. 
I was able to understand the fundamentals and get to try out using linux 
for the frist time. Ever since then I looked forward to going to my labs in CPSC120.

*Lab 3
Lab 3 was my first introduction to a more or less, complex assignment. 
It was fun to code both part 1 and part 2. I personally enjoyed part 1
over part 2 due t0 part one having easier instructions to follow. 

*Lab 6 
Lab 6 was my fist challange and best comeback. I specifically enjoyed sandwich.cc
because I had fun tweaking the std::cout words before output and as well 
as changing up the words that are not sanwich ingredients.
